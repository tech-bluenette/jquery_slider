To do list made to practice day 1 of jQuery.

At this point it’s definitely not much to look at, but I spent a lot
of time thoroughly learning what each step of my code did in detail
so I’m pleased with the amount of knowledge I gained from this, and 
hope to make it look awesome when I get some extra time :)
